          <h1 class="homepage-title">About My Projects</h2>

          <p>Below are a few details about some of the projects I have worked on at various hackathons or own my own. They're all also on my <a href="http://github.com/rohan-varma"> Github</a>.</p>

          <h1 class="homepage-title">Prediction of House Prices Using a Neural Network</h2>
          <p>This project is currently under progess. Using publicly available data about houses and their sale price, I am working to create a neural network that predicts house prices. The use of a neural network is being investigated over classic linear regrssion to see whether house prices have a significnt nonlinearity component (for example, a large house means a higher price, unless it is in a certain zipcode). </p>

          <h1 class="homepage-title">Classifying Elite MLB Athletes</h2>
          <p>This is a project I worked on at Hudl's intern hackathon in a group with three other interns. We were interested in applying machine learning and data analysis techniques to elite sports. We leveraged a dataset consisting of batting and pitching data of MLB athletes and implemented a custom version of the k-nearest-neighbors algorithmt to group similar athletes together. This project consisted of several components: a database to store our data, a class to interact with and read data from the database, a layer that preprocess the data, and finally the k-nearest neighbors algorithm. We wrapped our trained algorithm in a simple API and created a front-end for users to seach for specific athletes.</p>


          <h1 class="homepage-title">Neural Network to classify MNIST dataset</h2>
          <p>This project consisted of an implementation of a neural network with a single layer to classify digits from the MNIST dataset. It's the "Hello World" of deep learning. Much of the implementation of the neural network was based on Sebastian Raska's book, "Python Machine Learning". It achieved a 96% accuracy on the MNIST dataset.</p>
