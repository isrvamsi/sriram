          <h1 class="homepage-title">Undergraduate Research - UCLA's Bio and Nano Photonics Laboratory</h2>

          <p>I'm currently an undergraduate researcher at UCLA's Bio and Nano Photonics Laboratory, led by Dr. Aydogan Ozcan. I mainly work on machine learning related research and help prepare and image biological samples.</p>

          <h1 class="homepage-title">Recent Work</h2>
          <p>Our most recent research project involves the automated detection of sickle cells in blood cell samples. Through use of a smartphone-based microscope and 3D printed slide, we were able to capture images of blood samples. Then, these samples are sent to a server that runs a trained machine learning algorithm. The goal is to label each cell as sickled, red, or white. Using this information, we can predict the likelihood of a patient having sickle cell disease. Since this method does not require an expert pathologist to label each cell or expensive lab equipment, it can be of use especially in third-world countries where such access to medical equipment is scarce.</p>

          <h1 class="homepage-title">Publications and presentations</h2>
          <p>This research has been presented at the 17th Annual UC Systemwide Bioengineering Symposium at UCSF. An abstract has also been submitted to the Southern California Conferences for Undergraduate Research.</p>


          <h1 class="homepage-title">Upcoming work</h2>
          <p>We are continuing to work on our sickle cell detection research. Currently, we are experimenting with several different machine learning algorithms and using hyperparameter tuning to maximize our classification accuracy. Specifically, the use of a deep neural network to solve this problem is being investigated. Additionally, we are working on an application and robust backend to test our project in a production-level fashion.</p>
